How to Sign In to Your Vidgo TV Account

To sign in, start by opening the Vidgo TV app or visiting the official Vidgo website in your browser. Click or tap on the “Sign In” option typically found at the top right of the screen. Enter your registered email address and password in the required fields. Once you submit the credentials, you’ll be taken to your dashboard or homepage where you can start watching live TV or browse available shows.

Make sure your internet connection is active before attempting to sign in. If you’re using a mobile device or smart TV, ensure that your Vidgo app is updated to the latest version for the best experience.
